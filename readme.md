## Artist Sequelize Example

This is a demo repo to work and build an API using Sequelize ORM for node.


There is a missing model to be created using sequelize: songs
The model has a relationship with albums and has the following attributes:
```
id
name
duration
album_id
```

Also Create an user model to sign up and login and the user is the only one that can modify or add data to the database.

There is also a server.js file for the endpoints that need to be created:

Check the file to see which endpoints will need to be defined.
